    <h2>The World of Monsters</h2>

    <p>
        The Supernatural universe is filled with creatures from mythology, folklore, and urban legends.
        Throughout 15 seasons, the Winchester brothers have hunted everything from common ghosts to
        ancient biblical beings. Each creature follows its own set of rules, weaknesses, and behaviors
        that hunters must learn to survive. The Men of Letters have spent centuries cataloging these monsters
        in extensive bestiaries.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hunting monsters isn't just about weapons — it requires knowledge and preparation.
        What works on a vampire won't work on a demon. Some creatures can only be killed with specific items:
        silver for werewolves, iron for ghosts, or an angel blade for celestial beings.
        The Winchesters carry a mobile arsenal in their iconic 1967 Chevrolet Impala, ready for
        any supernatural threat.

    <h2>Most Iconic Creatures</h2>

        <dt>Demons</dt>
        <dd>
            Demons are malevolent spiritual entities that are considered the direct opposites to angels. They are
            created from human souls who have endured prolonged extreme torture in Hell. Via this process, they
            become corrupted, extremely evil, and also very powerful. Similar to Angels, they are spiritual entities
            and therefore require a vessel to fully interact with the physical world, though they are able to roam
            around in their smoke form. The species as a whole functions as the series' primary antagonists and are
            the most recurring supernatural creatures in the series.
            They can be expelled through exorcism rituals, trapped with Devil's Traps, or killed with weapons like
            the demon-killing knife or the Colt. Holy water burns them and reveals their presence.
        </dd>

        <dt>Vampires</dt>
        <dd>
            Unlike traditional lore, Supernatural vampires are created when a human drinks vampire blood. They
            develop retractable fangs and feed on human blood to survive. They possess enhanced strength,
            speed, and hearing, and can only be killed by decapitation. Dead Man's Blood acts as a poison that
            weakens them. Vampires in this universe are not affected by sunlight or religious symbols, making them
            particularly dangerous. They often live in nests with a hierarchical structure led by an Alpha vampire.
        </dd>

        <dt>Werewolves</dt>
        <dd>
            Werewolves in Supernatural transform during the full moon, though some can learn to control their
            transformations. The condition is transmitted through a bite and causes the victim to develop heightened
            aggression and cannibalistic urges. They retain no memory of their actions while transformed. The only
            way to kill a werewolf is with a silver bullet to the heart. Pure-blood werewolves, who are born rather
            than bitten, have greater control and can transform at will.
        </dd>

        <dt>Angels</dt>
        <dd>
            Angels are celestial beings created by God to serve Heaven and protect humanity. They require a
            human vessel to interact with Earth and possess immense powers including teleportation, healing, and
            time manipulation. Angels communicate through a frequency that sounds like high-pitched ringing to
            humans. They can be killed with angel blades, special weapons forged in Heaven, or by having their
            grace removed. Holy fire can trap them temporarily. Despite their holy nature, many angels in the series
            prove to be ruthless and authoritarian, willing to sacrifice humans for "the greater good."
        </dd>

        <dt>Ghosts</dt>
        <dd>
            Ghosts are spirits of deceased humans who remain bound to Earth due to unfinished business,
            violent deaths, or powerful emotional attachments. They can move objects, manipulate electricity,
            and in extreme cases cause physical harm. Ghosts are invisible to most humans but can be seen through
            electromagnetic field (EMF) detectors or captured on camera. Salt and iron repel them temporarily,
            while burning their remains or the object they're attached to will put them to rest permanently.
            Some ghosts become violent and vengeful over time, losing their humanity completely.
