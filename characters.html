    <h2>Supporting Characters</h2>

    <p>
        While Sam, Dean, and Castiel form the core of the show, <strong>Supernatural</strong> features numerous
        memorable supporting characters who help, hinder, or challenge the Winchesters throughout their journey.
        From fellow hunters to supernatural allies, these characters add depth and complexity to the series' universe.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Bobby Singer</dt>
        <dd>
            A seasoned hunter and father figure to Sam and Dean. Bobby runs a salvage yard that serves as
            a safe haven for hunters. He possesses extensive knowledge of the supernatural and maintains
            a vast library of occult books. His gruff exterior hides a deep love for the Winchester brothers,
            and his catchphrase <em>"Idjits!"</em> became iconic among fans. Bobby sacrifices himself to help
            the brothers defeat the Leviathans.
        </dd>

        <dt>Crowley</dt>
        <dd>
            The King of Hell and one of the show's most complex characters. Originally a Scottish tailor named
            Fergus MacLeod in the 17th century, Crowley sold his soul and became a crossroads demon before
            rising to power. Despite being a demon, he forms unexpected alliances with the Winchesters,
            often helping them when it serves his interests. His witty dialogue and morally gray actions make
            him a fan favorite.
        </dd>

        <dt>Rowena MacLeod</dt>
        <dd>
            A powerful 300-year-old Scottish witch and Crowley's mother. Rowena is cunning, ambitious, and
            possesses immense magical abilities. Initially an antagonist, she eventually becomes an ally to
            the Winchesters. Her complicated relationship with her son Crowley and her journey from villain to
            hero showcases some of the series' best character development.
        </dd>

        <dt>Jack Kline</dt>
        <dd>
            The Nephilim son of Lucifer, born with immense cosmic powers. Despite his terrifying heritage,
            Jack is raised by Sam, Dean, and Castiel, who teach him to use his powers for good. His childlike
            innocence combined with god-like abilities creates unique challenges. Jack eventually becomes the
            new God, replacing Chuck Shurley and restoring balance to the universe.
